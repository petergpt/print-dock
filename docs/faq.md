# FAQ

**Why doesn’t it show up as a normal macOS printer?**
The Hi·Print is designed for app-driven Bluetooth printing and doesn’t expose a standard macOS print queue.

**The printer disconnects quickly.**
The device auto-sleeps after short idle periods. Turn it on right before printing.

**Bluetooth permission prompts never appear.**
Ensure you’re using the packaged app or Xcode target with Bluetooth usage strings.
